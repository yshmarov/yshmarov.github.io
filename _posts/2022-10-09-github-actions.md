From my experience, here are some best practices when working on git with a team:

- Disable pushing directly to `main` branch;
- All changes should come via Pull Request (PR);
- A PR should have at least 1 approval (if more than 1 collaborator);
- Disable merging a PR until **checks** pass;

- Also, preferably, "update with rebase" when you can (not "update with merge commit");

![git-rebase.png](/assets/images/git-rebase.png)

Usually to ensure code quality you would use run `tests` and `linters` locally.

Usually code storage solutions like Github/Gitlab allow you to run these tests in a virtual environment.

That way, you and your team can be sure that the tests are successful before merging a PR without having to re-run the tests on their machines.

The Github tool that allows you to run this sort of scripts in a virtual environment is called **Github Actions**.

To start using Github Actions on a repo, you would need to add a folder like `.github/workflows` in the root directory of your app.

Next, you could add `yml` scripts inside the folder. Here's an example script:

![git-github-action-workflow.png](/assets/images/git-github-action-workflow.png)

The above script would run `rubocop` on your app whenever a pull request is created, or commits are pushed to it and provide a `success`/`failure` state:

![git-rubocop-action.png](/assets/images/git-rubocop-action.png)

Setting up the CI to run for linters is usally straightforward. You can find the code version of the above script in the article [Install and use Rubocop](https://blog.superails.com/install-and-use-rubocop).

The common **"Checks"** are:

- rspec/minitest tests
- [rubocop linting](https://blog.superails.com/install-and-use-rubocop)
- [erb linting](https://blog.superails.com/erb-linting)
- javascript linting
- deploying to a PR app

### Setting up CI for **tests**

This is usually harder, because it requires **running** the app.

Common "problems" are:

- installing Redis
- installing Postgresql
- adding credentials

Now let's

- add a basic page to a Rails app
- test the page locally
- finally add a script to test the page with Github Actions

```shell
rails g controller static_pages landing_page
```

```html
<!-- app/views/static_pages/landing_page.html.erb -->
<h1>hello world</h1>
```

```ruby
# test/system/static_pages_test.rb
require 'application_system_test_case'
class StaticPagesTest < ApplicationSystemTestCase
  test 'visiting the homepage' do
    visit static_pages_landing_page_url
    assert_text 'hello world'
  end
end
```

To run system tests in CI, you will need to use `headless chrome`:

```ruby
# test/application_system_test_case.rb
require 'test_helper'
class ApplicationSystemTestCase < ActionDispatch::SystemTestCase
  # driven_by :selenium, using: :chrome, screen_size: [1400, 1400]
  driven_by :selenium, using: :headless_chrome, screen_size: [1400, 1400]
end
```

Run tests:

```shell
# bin/rails test
# bin/rails test:all
bin/rails test --fail-fast
```

Run system tests:

```shell
bin/rails test:system
```

### Troubleshoot Github Actions with rails credentials

Running some tests would require having valid credentials.

Here's how you can add `master.key` with a value `34tjk3ngiovv3j409jc34jt90v3q4jt4` to Github Actions using the Github GUI:

![git-add-secrets.png](/assets/images/git-add-secrets.png)

(Name should be `RAILS_MASTER_KEY`).

It can later be accessed in the CI yaml file as `secrets.RAILS_MASTER_KEY` ⤵️

### Finally, the CI script

This script works for me to install postgres, redis, run tests, re-run seeds.

{% raw %}

```yml
# .github/workflows/.tests.yml
name: CI
on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - "*"
  push:
    branches:
      - main
jobs:
  install-cache:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 10
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Commit
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Install Ruby
        uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1
        with:
          bundler-cache: true
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: install-cache
    timeout-minutes: 10
    services:
      postgres:
        image: postgres
        ports: ["5432:5432"]
        env:
          POSTGRES_USER: postgres
          POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
        options: >-
          --health-cmd pg_isready
          --health-interval 10s
          --health-timeout 5s
          --health-retries 5
      redis:
        image: redis
        ports:
          - "6379:6379"
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Commit
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Install Ruby
        uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1
        with:
          bundler-cache: true
      - name: Install system dependencies
        run: |
          sudo apt-get -y update
      - name: Run tests
        env:
          RAILS_ENV: test
          DATABASE_URL: postgres://postgres:password@localhost:5432/myapp_test
          # RAILS_MASTER_KEY: ${{ secrets.RAILS_MASTER_KEY }}
        run: |
          bin/rails tailwindcss:build
          bin/rails db:create
          bin/rails db:schema:load
          bin/rails test --fail-fast
          bin/rails test:system
      - name: Smoke test database seeds
        env:
          RAILS_ENV: test
          DATABASE_URL: postgres://postgres:password@localhost:5432/myapp_test
          # RAILS_MASTER_KEY: ${{ secrets.RAILS_MASTER_KEY }}
        run: bundle exec rails db:reset
```

{% endraw %}

Finally, here are example CI scripts from open source RoR projects:

- [avo-hq/avo CI](https://github.com/avo-hq/avo/tree/main/.github/workflows)
- [joemasilotti/railsdevs.com CI](https://github.com/joemasilotti/railsdevs.com/tree/main/.github/workflows)

That's it!
