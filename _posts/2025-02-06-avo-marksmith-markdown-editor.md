### The age of Markdown

In late 2024, Microsoft released [microsoft/markitdown](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown), a tool for converting files and office documents to Markdown.

PlanetScale uses MARKDOWN for its' marketing pages.

Also my friend [Jeremy Smith](https://x.com/jeremysmithco) built [Liminal Forum](https://liminal.forum) that features a custom markdown editor.

At Rails World 2024 DHH teased **House (MD)**, a new **markdown editor** for Rails.

### Marksmith by Avo

Nobody knows when House (MD) will actually be released, but in the meantime Avo built [Marksmith](https://github.com/avo-hq/marksmith), a markdown editor for Rails.

I plan to integrate it into [SupeRails](https://superails.com) soon.
