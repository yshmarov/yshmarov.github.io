#### Topic

Hotwire Datatables with Rails. Frontend tips & tricks

#### Short description

Learn how to build **maintainable** reactive Rails frontends

#### Description

5/6 of my latest clients needed to solve the "datatables problem": having tables (or lists) of data that can be searched, sorted, filtered, paginated, bulk and individual actions.

![Datatables example](/assets/images/cfp-datatables.png)

I will show my approach to creating Hotwire datatables while solving common problems.

We will cover:

Common Hotwire mistakes & best practices:

- unnessesary declarations
- full page reload VS frames VS streams
- Fat VS skinny stimulus controllers
- Bulk update via turbo streams
- etc.

Common frontend questions:

- When to use ViewComponents vs Partials?
- When to use Helpers?
- When to abstract a TailwindCSS class?
- Should I create my own component library?
- etc.

Common paterns:

- Helpers I wish rails had (`active_link_to`, etc.)
- Stimulus controllers every app should have (`remove_element`, `debounce`, etc.)
- etc.

Bonus (if time allows):

- HTML tips that will make your Hotwire journey easier.
- Useful tools in the ecosystem (stimulus-use, stimulus-components, turbo_boost-commands, custom turbo stream actions)
