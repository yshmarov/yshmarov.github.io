You open Instagram — and suddenly, everyone's having babies.  
👶 Big, happy families.  
👗 Matching outfits.  
🍼 Wholesome chaos.

But look closer — they're all _wealthy_.  
💸 Turns out, having lots of kids is the new status symbol.

Just 20 years ago, large families were usually a sign of limited means. Feeding five or more people was tough, and the living conditions reflected that. The wealthy, meanwhile, stuck to one or two kids — it made sense.

📜 Go back 150 years, and it was even clearer:  
Peasants had more children because every extra pair of hands helped on the farm. More kids meant more work done — and a better shot at survival.

🏰 In elite families, it was the opposite. Children meant splitting inheritance more ways. So, one heir — preferably a son — was often enough.

But that logic is gone.  
Today, having three or more kids quietly says:  
🧸 "We can afford to give _each_ of them a great life."

Millennials and Gen Z, raised in economic uncertainty, want better for their kids:  
🔒 Stability  
🛏️ Space  
🎓 Opportunity  
🧠 Autonomy  
💞 Emotional safety

And that's expensive.

Nannies, tutors, time, attention — it all adds up.  
So while luxury used to mean yachts and watches ⛵⌚, now it looks more like:  
🍽️ Dinner at a big table  
🖐️ Sticky fingers  
🏡 A noisy house full of love

Honestly?  
It feels like a healthier kind of wealth.
